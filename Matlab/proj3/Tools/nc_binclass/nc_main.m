%NC_MAIN    Neural classifier main program
%  Main program for neural network training
%  This program implements binary classification 
%  using the logistic sigmoidal function
%
%  The network is trained using a BFGS optimization algorithm
%  using soft line search to determine step length.
%
%  Regularization is adapted with MacKays Bayesian MLII scheme
%  with only one regularization parameter for all weights.
%
%  This program is based on an older neural classifier programmed by 
%  Morten With Pedersen in February 1997. The following has been added
%  *Adaptive regularization with MacKays evidence scheme. 2001 Siggi 
%  *Gauss-Newton Hessian matrix evaluation.               2001 Siggi 
%  *Use BFGS algorithm for weigth optimization.           2001 Siggi
%  *Binary classification.                                2002 Siggi
%
%  The BFGS optimization program 'ucminf.m' 
%  was written by Hans Bruun Nielsen at IMM, DTU.
